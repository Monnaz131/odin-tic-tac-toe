# Odin-tic-tac-toe

A Tic Tac Toe game will be created that can be played using the terminal.

I will create a class that will do the following:
1. Ask 2 users for their names.
2. Create a game board.
3. Let each user choose an open spot on the board, and then change it to their symbol.
4. Check if valid choices are made, and will ask the user to input again if it was invalid.
5. Check to see who wins, and then display a message to say who has won the game.
